# cordova-plugin-hidescrollbar

Very basic plugin to hide scrollbar in a Cordova app.

This is still incomplete and in alpha stage.

# Supported platforms

- iOS

# How to use

The development is still in progress to provide a simpler interface. For now:

```cordova.exec(function(){}, function(){}, "HideScrollbar", "hideScrollbars", []);```
